PART 1

1. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and this is how browsers and servers communicate

2. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and this is an address to a resource on the internet
	ex) www.google.com

3. DNS stands for Domain Name System and this translates urls like www.google.com to a unique IP address.

4. Query string is part of the URL and this provides additional information and can be multiple parameters. 

5. The two HTTP verbs are GET and POST . GET is 'asking (retrieve)' data without changing server data . No side effects.	POST is when there is intent to have a side effects or to modify data in the server. ex) sending mail, posting a post, charging credit card , etc

6. HTTP request is a request from a user to a server that follows the http protocol. Asking the server at www.google.com to provide content of the HTMl. 

7. HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response. 
	Request headers: User-Agent , Accept, Authorization, Cookie, Cache-Control
	Response header: HTTP Status, Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control

8. When you type a URL into a browser there are several things that happen
	-Browser takes the url address to a machine readable IP Address. This is done by DNS
	-The browser will then request to that IP address including all info about the browser as 		well as any previous cookies, etc
	- The server then responds with the exact HTML text for that page as well as a status code
	- The browser receives the response and starts rendering the page and processes HTML, css, 		javascript 
	- The browser requests additional resources such as images and other stylesheets and scripts 		referenced in the HTML.
